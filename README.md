# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset to understand its structure, detect patterns, and extract meaningful insights. It uses Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for data manipulation and visualization.

## Features
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and duplicates
- Data Exploration: Summary statistics and data types
- Univariate Analysis: Histograms, boxplots, and frequency counts
- Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis: Scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, and boxplots
- Outlier Detection: Identify unusual data points
- Visualizations: Clear and informative graphs for insights

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
